The country's wildlife is diverse and includes a variety of species, some of which are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. The combination of diverse habitats, ranging from dense forests and grasslands to wetlands and coastal areas, contributes to the remarkable array of wildlife in Sri Lanka.
